<h1>Club Throw - a Paralympic sport</h1><br>
<strong>Club throw</strong>  is a part of the track and field events at the Paralympic Games, in which the objective is to throw a wooden club as far as possible. The sport is currently practiced only by disabled athletes. Competitive events are conducted for both men and women.
<br>
The club used for club throw is designed to specifications, and resembles a baseball bat, with a handle and a thicker body. The club should weigh a minimum of 397 grams.
<br>
Like many Paralympics sports, club throw athletes are classified into different classes based on their levels of disability. The three classes for club throw are, F31, F32 and F51 . Separate medal competitions are conducted for all three classes during the Summer Paralympics.
<br>
During competitions, each athlete throws the club from a sitting position on a rigid frame within the throwing area about 7" - 8'2'' in diameter. The end of the club closest to the throwing line is used for measuring the distance of the throw. The athlete with the farthest throw is declared as the winner.
<br>
Club throw has been a part of the Summer Paralympics Games since 1960. The women's event was dropped in 1992 and was again reinstated during the 2012 London Olympics.
