Swimming is the sport or activity of propelling oneself through water using the limbs. Competitive swimming is usually performed in a 25m or 50m pool, using various stroke styles. Some other officially regulated strokes by International Swimming Federation (FINA) include freestyle, butterfly, breaststroke and backstroke. These four strokes combine to make up the medley events.
<br>
Long-distance open water swimming events are also held on open water, such as rivers and oceans. Swimming is also a part of other sports, such as triathlon.

The major competitions for men and women events are the short and long course world championships and the Olympics too. Swimming is one of the most renowned sports of the summer Olympics.
