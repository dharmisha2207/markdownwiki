<br>
Javelin or javelin throw is part of the  land field  event. A javelin or a spear about 8 feet long is used to throw for maximum distance. The participant runs first within a predetermined area and then throws the javelin.
<br>
The IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federation) stated that non-orthodox techniques cannot be used in javelin throw. The participants must hold the javelin at its grip and throw over hands, over the participant’s upper arm or shoulder.
<br>
Like other throwing competitions, the participant is not allowed to leave the area until the javelin has landed. The participants throw the javelin towards a sector which has an angle of 28.96 degrees extending outwards from the end of the runway.
<br>
Javelin is a part of the men’s decathlon and the women’s heptathlon. In international competitions, men use a javelin between 8 feet 6 inches and 8 feet 10 inches; the women use a javelin between 7 feet 3 inches and 7 feet 7 inches.
