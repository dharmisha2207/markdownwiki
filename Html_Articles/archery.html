<h1>The Sport of Archery</h1><br>
<img src= https://www.topendsports.com/sport/archery/images/archer-freeimages.jpg alt= archery bow><br>. Derived from Latin word ‘arcus’, archery was only used for combating and hunting purposes in ancient times. But today it’s a popular competitive sport. In the 1840s, archery was taken to the level of modern sport from merely a recreational activity.
<br>
At the 1900 Paris Olympics, Archery was approved as Summer Olympics sport. The only discipline of this sport featured at the Olympics is Recurve Archery - a type of Target Archery. Archery is also a Summer Paralympics event.
