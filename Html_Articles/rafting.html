<strong>River Rafting</strong>  is a competitive sport in which the objective is to navigate downstream on river rapids using an inflated raft. It is considered an extreme sport that is highly challenging and risky, and requires a great deal of teamwork. Rafting is also an extremely popular recreational activity practiced in most countries around the world.

<br>
<ul>
<li>   <strong>Sprint</strong>: Conducted in either an individual format or a head-to-head format in which riders have to complete the course through the best possible route.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>   <strong>Slalom</strong>: In this type of race, the course consists of slalom-like turns and riders have to successfully navigate around them.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
All rafting races are team races in which 2 - 8 riders take part. Regardless of the type of race, the objective is to complete the course in the fastest time possible.
