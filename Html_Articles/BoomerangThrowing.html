<h1>Boomerang Throwing</h1><br>
The boomerang is a traditional hunting implement of the Australian Aborigines, though evidence of a similar implement have also been found in other cultures. The competitive sport of boomerang throwing was developed with the growing popularity and usage of boomerangs. The sport is popular in Australia, Germany, Switzerland, and the United States.
<br>
There are several types of boomerang events that are included in competitions. Some of them are,
<br>
<ul>

<br>
In all events, players compete individually and all throws have to travel at least 20m to be considered as a valid throw.
<br>
The first World Boomerang Championships were held in Australia in 1988, though since then the event has been held at different locations around the world.
