<br>
Chess is a strategy board game played by two players on a checkered gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8 by 8 grid. Each player begins the game with 16 chess pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.
<br>
Each of the six chess piece types has particular ways of moving around the board. The objective of the game is to use a player's pieces to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, ultimately to checkmate the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture.
<br>
Whether chess is a sport is debatable. Chess does not fit our  definition of a real sport  as it is not primarily a human physical activity, but is included on our list of sports as some people believe it should be.
<br>
The game has some official recognition, with the World Chess Federation an IOC Recognized International Sports Federations, and also being a member of the International Mind Sports Association and the Global Association of International Sports Federations. A chess tournament was also included in the 2006 and 2010 Asian Games.
