<br>
Ball badminton is a team game and a type of racket sport, that is played in India. Ball badminton is played using a yellow ball made of wool, rather than a shuttlecock as in badminton.
<br>
Ball badminton is played on a court, which is around 12 by 24 meters, divided by a net. Ball badminton can either be played outdoors or indoors.
<br>
Games are played between two teams, usually with five players per team. There are also doubles and mixed doubles versions. In these formats, two players from each team participate.
<br>
The game starts when the ball is served. The server should be on the right side of the court, and the server should move to the left when a point is scored. The ball can be returned by any of the players of the opposing team.
<br>
When the team reaches the 18th, 15th, and 22nd point, the teams change positions, but the server will continue to change between the right and left courts. In “fives” tournaments, a team can have eight formally designated players, and any of the five can plays. In doubles, the team use three players. Substitutions are allowed at any time.
