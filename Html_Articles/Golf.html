<h1>About Golf</h1><br>

<br>
Golf is a sport in which players use a club to hit a ball into a series of holes on a course, using the fewest number of strokes.
<br>
Golf does not require a standardized playing area. Traditional golf is played on a course which has an arranged progression of nine or eighteen holes. The holes need to contain a tee box to start from, and finish with a green containing the hole. There may be hazards such as trees, sand bunkers and water holes.
<br>
Golf is usually played for the lowest number of strokes by the golfer - known as  <strong>stroke play<em>*. Golf can also be played using  *</em>match play</strong>  rules, with scoring based on the lowest score on the most individual holes during a complete round.
<br>
The common scores for a stroke are: -4 or condor, which means four strokes under par; -3 or albatross, which means three strokes under par; -2 or eagle, which mans two strokes under par; -1 or birdie, which means one stroke under par; E or Par, which means equal to par; +1 or bogey, which means one stroke over par; +2 or double boogey, which mean two strokes over par; and +3 or triple boogey which means three strokes over par.
