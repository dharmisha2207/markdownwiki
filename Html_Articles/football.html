<h1>Football</h1><br>
Football is a name for popular sports played around the world, and includes soccer and rugby codes. These different variations of football are basically known as the football codes. In general, football is played between two teams consisting of 11 to 18 players. There are also some  other variations  of this sport in which there are less number of players on each team.
<br>
There is a clearly defined area with a goal scoring area on each end, in which both teams have to play and score goals. You will be able to score a point, try, touchdown or goal by moving the ball to the opposing team’s end of the field. Goals are scored by the players putting the ball into the goal area.
<br>
Players have different methods of moving the ball depending on the code, such as kicking, carrying, throwing and hand passing the ball to the other player. Players are only allowed to use their body to move the ball. There are also some codes of football which include catching, kicking, tackling and passing.
