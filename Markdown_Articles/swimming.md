Swimming is the sport or activity of propelling oneself through water using the limbs. Competitive swimming is usually performed in a 25m or 50m pool, using various stroke styles. Some other officially regulated strokes by International Swimming Federation (FINA) include freestyle, butterfly, breaststroke and backstroke. These four strokes combine to make up the medley events.
