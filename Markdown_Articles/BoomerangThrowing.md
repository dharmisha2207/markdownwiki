# Boomerang Throwing

The boomerang is a traditional hunting implement of the Australian Aborigines, though evidence of a similar implement have also been found in other cultures. The competitive sport of boomerang throwing was developed with the growing popularity and usage of boomerangs. The sport is popular in Australia, Germany, Switzerland, and the United States.

There are several types of boomerang events that are included in competitions. Some of them are,

-   **Aussie Round**: A 50m distance test in which each thrower gets five attempts, and are awarded points based on distance, accuracy and catch.
-   **Accuracy**: A test for how close a boomerang falls close to a target.
-   **Endurance**: Competition for maximum number of catches in five minutes.
-   **Fast Catch**: A time-trial competition to achieve fastest time for five catches.
-   **Trick Catch**: Players are judged on tricks like catching behind back, or between legs.
-   **Doubling**: Throw and catch two boomerangs in a specified sequence.
-   **Consecutive Catch**: A non-timed test for number of consecutive catches without a drop.
-   **MTA 100**: Contest to keep the boomerang in air for maximum time possible in a 100m field.
-   **Long Distance**: A competition to find the longest throw.

In all events, players compete individually and all throws have to travel at least 20m to be considered as a valid throw.

The first World Boomerang Championships were held in Australia in 1988, though since then the event has been held at different locations around the world.
