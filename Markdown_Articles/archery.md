![archery bow](https://www.topendsports.com/sport/archery/images/archer-freeimages.jpg)In the sport of archery, the archer uses a bow to propel arrows to hit the target from set distance(s). Derived from Latin word ‘arcus’, archery was only used for combating and hunting purposes in ancient times. But today it’s a popular competitive sport. In the 1840s, archery was taken to the level of modern sport from merely a recreational activity.

At the 1900 Paris Olympics, Archery was approved as Summer Olympics sport. The only discipline of this sport featured at the Olympics is Recurve Archery - a type of Target Archery. Archery is also a Summer Paralympics event.

## Common Archery Sport Types include:

-  **Target Archery**  — competitions held indoors or outdoors between 18 m and 90 m from the target.
