Skiing is a mode of transportation in which a pair of objects, one for each leg, called skis is used to glide over various types of surfaces. Snow skiing is the oldest and the most popular form of skiing that led the way to development of other types of skiing like, grass skiing, sand skiing, and water skiing. Skiing is extensively practiced as a recreational activity and is also extensively contested in competitive events.

Let's take a brief look at the different types of skiing:

**Snow Skiing**  : Involves skiing on snow. There are several types of competitive events conducted for snow skiing.
