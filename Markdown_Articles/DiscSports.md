Disc sports or flying disc games, are sports or games played using discs. This sport is often called Frisbee, which is a trademark name for the flying disc. The flying disc was invented by Walter Morrison in 1948. About 10 years later, the company Wham-o brought the rights to the device, and promoted it as a new toy called a Frisbee, which it is popularly known as today.
