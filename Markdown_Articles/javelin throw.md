Javelin or javelin throw is part of the  land field  event. A javelin or a spear about 8 feet long is used to throw for maximum distance. The participant runs first within a predetermined area and then throws the javelin.

The IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federation) stated that non-orthodox techniques cannot be used in javelin throw. The participants must hold the javelin at its grip and throw over hands, over the participant’s upper arm or shoulder.

Like other throwing competitions, the participant is not allowed to leave the area until the javelin has landed. The participants throw the javelin towards a sector which has an angle of 28.96 degrees extending outwards from the end of the runway.

Javelin is a part of the men’s decathlon and the women’s heptathlon. In international competitions, men use a javelin between 8 feet 6 inches and 8 feet 10 inches; the women use a javelin between 7 feet 3 inches and 7 feet 7 inches.
