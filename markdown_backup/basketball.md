Basketball is one of the most popular sports around the world. It is played by two teams, with five players on each team. Their score is based on the number of shots made through the hoop on the opponent’s court. The aim is to outscore the other team.

Basketball started in December 1891 when a physical education professor and instructor at the YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts was looking for a way for the gym class to be active on a rainy day. Initially, they had used a peach basket elevated 10 feet high at each end of the court. Eventually, they removed the bottom part of the basket so that ball will just fall out of it right away. The ball makes its way to the basket through a pass, tap, throw, roll, dribble, and shoot.

Nowadays, for official games all equipment is regulated. For the men’s game the ball should have a circumference of 29.50 inches and should weigh 22 oz. For women’s, it should be 28.5 inches in circumference and should weigh 20 oz. The court should be 28 meters long and 15 meters wide. The basket is now a steel ring with an 18-inch diameter and a net attached to it. The backboard, where the steel ring is attached, measures 6 feet by 3.5 feet. It is elevated 10 feet high and 4 feet from the baseline.
